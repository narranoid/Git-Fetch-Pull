# Git-Fetch-Pull
Small library for fetching and pulling from Git repositories, including LFS support.

## Usage
Personally, I am using these scripts combined with Git Bash and TortoiseGit. I place the scripts inside a repository and run them from file explorer with GitBash. This is useful, because through these scripts, regular and LFS fetch/pull is available with a single click.
Commit and push is handled by TortoiseGit, which is available via right click in the file explorer.
